# Donate

!!! warning
    The information on this page is outdated and needs to be updated.

Mingw-w64 is almost entirely made by volunteer. Only two employees are paid to
contribute to mingw-w64 and even then it's not full-time: we estimate the paid
time spent on the project matches 0.5-employee. All other contributions are done
on free time.

There are many evolutions and features planned but resources are scarce. In
particular, if mingw-w64 saves you from the steep cost of proprietary
toolchains, think about contributing a bit; you will also most likely quickly
benefit from the improvements.

## Non-financial contributions

More than through money, the best way to help the project is to invest man-time
in it. The list of tasks on the [page about
contributing](./contribute.md) is the best place to start
and if you are an employer with trainees, several of these tasks will make good
internship.

## Donations

With the current organization and funds of mingw-w64, it wouldn't make sense to
try to pay a developer to spend time on specific topics. Instead, the money will
be spent on hardware (testing servers, Windows licenses, phone, tablets, ...)
and meeting expenses (setting up hackatons and paying for travel expenses as
some major mingw-w64 developers live very far from others).

Currently, only Paypal is available:

Below is a list of donors, starting from January 2015. We'd like to
list all our donors but we value your wishes; please state whether
you'd like to have your name, pseudonym or company on the website.

- James Beard
- [WSoptics GmbH](https://www.wsoptics.com/)

## Hardware donations

There is no facility at the moment to receive hardware. These donations will
have to be handled on a case-by-case basis (mostly to decide where to ship).
